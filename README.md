A collection of useful batch scripts written by myself (with a bit of help from amakvana) in a single program. Always trying to update it.

# What Programs does Scripty include?

Currently, (as of March 16, 2024) Scripty includes:

1. **Check Internet Status** - Allows you to type in any website or IP and sends a ping allows you to see if you are able to connect to it

   

2. **The organization feature** - Placing Scripty in a folder with lots of unorganized files and running the organize features allows the files to be sorted by type or by file extension.
   _(I can add more file types if they are requested)_

   

3. **Semi-Ransomware protection by changing file extensions of a folder and all of its subdirectories** - Because ransomware looks for specific file types to encrypt, this program will change the extension of the file to something that (hopefully) isn't targeted by ransomware.
This is perfect if you have a "long-term" storage drive or folder with unused files that are important to you. This feature is finished now. _(I can add more file types if they are requested)_

   _**IMPORTANT NOTE: SCRIPTY WILL CHANGE THE FILE EXTENSIONS OF ALL FILES IN THE FOLDER INCLUDING SUBDIRECTORIES**_

4. **Password Generator** - Uses alphanumeric and special characters to generate a password! Password length is set by the user in the program.


5. **MiniTweaks** - Allows you to turn on/off windows tansparency, Enable/Disable XBox Game Bar, and Add the Ultimate Performance Profile


6. **View Saved WiFi passwords** - Speaks for itself


7. **Remove Temporary files and empty Reycycle Bin** - Speaks for itself


8. **Crash This PC** - causes BSOD


9. **Timer and Stop Watch** - The user is able to set custom timer length (in seconds), and once the timer reaches zero, Scripty will play a ringtone. The stopwatch currently cannot be stopped without closing scripty, it will only keep counting.


10. **MD5 hash generator** - You can get the md5 hashes of all files where Scripty is placed, or you can specify a specific folder (output.txt will be placed in target directory w/ hashes of each file)


11. **Set Timezone** - As the name suggests, you can set your windows timezone from here. You can also view all windows timezones as well (will open in new window).


12. **Install Programs** - Can "install":  Brave Browser, Discord, Notepad++, OBS, GIMP, Steam, and VLC


13. **Open Startup Folders** - Opens The startup folder for the current user, and the startup folder for all users(if you have more than one user)


14. **Add/View USer Accounts** - Allows you to add/remove user accounts, view user accounts, and grant/revoke admin privileges of a user


15. **Resync Time/Date** - Does as the name suggests, it syncs the time/date if it gets messed up (for example if you dualboot linux, the date and time won't sync properly at times when you switch back to windows)


16. **Restart to BIOS/UEFI** - gives you some options to restart to the bios/uefi menus immediately or with a timer. Also has an option to cancel the shutdown/restart process


# Scripty can now update itself!! Just type update in the main menu and it will download an update if one is available!


# Why am I making this project?

For fun. That's it. I want to make something that other people like myself may want to use/experiment with.
