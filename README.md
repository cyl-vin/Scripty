A collection of useful batch scripts written by myself in a single program. Always trying to update it.

# Which Scripty should I choose?

There are 2 versions of Scripty. The first is the regular scripty version which will usually be updated first and include new all of the new features.

The second is Scripty-Color which just colors the scripty terminal and makes it really nice to look at.

# What Programs does Scripty include?

Currently, (as of March 7, 2024) Scripty includes:

1. **Check Internet Status** - Allows you to type in any website or IP and sends a ping allows you to see if you are able to connect to it

2. **The organization feature** - Placing Scripty in a folder with lots of unorganized files and running the organize features allows the files to be sorted by type or by file extension.
   _(I can add more file types if they are requested)_

3. **Semi-Ransomware protection** - Because ransomware looks for specific file types to encrypt, this program will change the extension of the file to something that (hopefully) isn't targeted by ransomware.
This is perfect if you have a "long-term" storage drive or folder with unused files that are important to you. This feature is finished now. _(I can add more file types if they are requested)_

   _**IMPORTANT NOTE: SCRIPTY WILL CHANGE THE FILE EXTENSIONS OF ALL FILES IN THE FOLDER INCLUDING SUBDRIRECTORIES**_

4. **Password Generator** - Uses alphanumeric and special characters to generate a password! Password length is set by the user in the program.

# Why am I making this project?

For fun. That's it. I want to make something that other people like myself may want to use/experiment with.
