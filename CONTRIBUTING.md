###How you can contribute:
-If you have an idea that can make Scripty better, just make a pull request with what you want to add or change. It's not necessary to use solor codes when adding/changing things or adding nice formatting/menus for a new item, but it is preffered. I can always add that stuff later on in my own time though. Just don't be dumb
